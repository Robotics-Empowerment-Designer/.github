# Node-(RED)<sup>2</sup>: Node-RED-based Robotics Empowerment Designer

Welcome to Node-(RED)<sup>2</sup>, an open-source visual programming tool/extension based on [Node-RED](https://github.com/node-red) to help users program robots for real-world scenarios, with a focus on human interaction and connectivity with Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. This tool has been created and is maintained within the [Human-Centered Robotics Lab](https://hcr-lab.de) at [Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences](https://ostfalia.de/en/).

Node-(RED)<sup>2</sup> is a self-hosted web application designed to allow **untrained users** to easily **create and configure scenarios for heterogeneous social robots**. Using custom nodes and flow control, this project leverages and extends the capabilities of Node-RED as a **visual programming** environment.

Currently supported robot models:
- Pepper
- Temi
- Sawyer

> **Note**:
> This application was referenced in the paper ***Weike, M., Ruske, K., Gerndt, R. & Doernbach, T., 2024. Enabling Untrained Users to Shape Real-World Robot Behavior Using an Intuitive Visual Programming Tool in Human-Robot Interaction Scenarios, in International Symposium on Technological Advances in Human-Robot Interaction**, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3648536.3648541*.

## Acknowledgments
- Special thanks go to the original developers and maintainers *Michel Weike* and *Kai Ruske* for the first version of this tool and the integration of the Pepper robot.
- *Loan Bernat* has developed the Sawyer middleware and for the first time created an interaction of multiple robots, as shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq2TTOWhma8
- *Robert Barabas* has made essential improvements and optimizations to the multi-robot setup, so that it is easy to use, robust and fast.
