# Node-(RED)<sup>2</sup>: Node-RED-based Robotics Empowerment Designer

Welcome to Node-(RED)<sup>2</sup>, an open-source visual programming tool/extension based on [Node-RED](https://github.com/node-red) to help users program robots for real-world scenarios, with a focus on human interaction and connectivity with Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.
Node-(RED)<sup>2</sup> is a self-hosted web application designed to allow even untrained users to easily create and configure scenarios for the humanoid robot Pepper from Aldebaran Robotics. Using custom nodes and flow control, this project leverages and extends the capabilities of Node-RED as a low-code (visual) programming environment.

We are currently working hard to integrate more robots into this application, such as:
- Sawyer (partially integrated)
- Temi (partially integrated)
- Baxter (NYI)

> **Note**:
> This application was referenced in the paper ***Weike, M., Ruske, K., Gerndt, R. & Doernbach, T., 2024. Enabling Untrained Users to Shape Real-World Robot Behavior Using an Intuitive Visual Programming Tool in Human-Robot Interaction Scenarios, in International Symposium on Technological Advances in Human-Robot Interaction***.
